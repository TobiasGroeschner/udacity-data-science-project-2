### Project Motivation

The goal of this project is to analyze demographic data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany. We will compare the demographic information of the customers with the general population. This project uses unsupervised learning for customer segmentation. Furthmore, a model will be developed predicting individuals most likely to become customers of the company. The data was provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.
